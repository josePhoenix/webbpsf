=======

WebbPSF is a simple tool for simulating point spread functions for the 
James Webb Space Telescope, inspired by TinyTim for Hubble.

It provides a relatively user-friendly interface for diffractive point spread 
function modeling for JWST in the Fraunhofer domain based on precomputed telescope models.

Developed by Marshall Perrin at STScI, 2010-2013. 

These packages have been developed on Python 2.7 but not yet tested for Python 3 compatibility.
